                        <h2>What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="ans">
                        <p>&#8608A Bootstrap Container is a fundamental building block in the Bootstrap framework,
                            designed to contain, pad, and align your content within a webpage.</p>
                        <p>&#8608 It is used to set the content's margins dealing with the responsive and fluid layout
                            of your web pages. Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are
                            required when using its default grid system.</p><br>
                        <p class="ex">Types of Containers in Bootstrap</p>
                        &#8627<p>
                        <p class="highlight">container</p>
                        <p>&#8608This class provides a responsive fixed-width container, meaning it changes its width at
                            different breakpoints to adapt to the size of the device screen, but the maximum width is
                            fixed at each breakpoint.</p>
                        <p class="highlight">container-fluid</p>
                        <p>&#8608This class provides a full-width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.
                            It's fluid and will always take up the full width available, regardless of the device or
                            screen size.</p><br>

                        <p class="ex">How Containers Work</p>
                        &#8627<p></p>
                        <p class="highlight">Padding</p>
                        <p>&#8608Containers include a bit of padding to prevent the content from touching the edges of
                            the screen, providing a better user experience.</p>
                        <p class="highlight">Centering</p>
                        <p>&#8608 The .container class centers your content horizontally within the parent element. It
                            does this by setting the margin-right and margin-left to auto, which effectively centers the
                            div if it has a specified width.</p>
                        <p class="highlight">Responsive Breakpoints</p>
                        <p>&#8608The .container adjusts its width based on predefined breakpoints (e.g., xs, sm, md, lg,
                            xl, xxl in Bootstrap 5), catering to different screen sizes. At each breakpoint, the
                            container's maximum width changes to adapt to the screen, ensuring that the content is
                            readable and accessible on any device.</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="que3  dis">
                    <div class="que">
                        <h2>What are the default Bootstrap text settings? </h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="ans">
                        <p class="highlight">Font Family</p>
                        <p>&#8608Bootstrap sets the default font family to the system's default sans-serif font, which
                            is typically used for better readability on various devices</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="highlight">Font Size</p>
                        <p>&#8608Bootstrap applies a base font size of 16 pixels (1rem) to the &lt;body&gt;element. Text
                            sizes are then defined using relative units like em or rem for responsiveness.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="highlight">Font Weight</p>
                        <p>&#8608The default font weight for regular text is typically normal (400), and for headings,
                            it may vary depending on the specific heading level.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="highlight">Line Height</p>
                        <p>&#8608Bootstrap sets a comfortable line height for better readability. The default is usually
                            around 1.5, creating space between lines of text.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="highlight">Text Color</p>
                        <p>&#8608The default text color is usually black or a dark color for better contrast on a light
                            background. Link colors may be different to distinguish them from regular text.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="highlight">Text Alignment</p>
                        <p>&#8608The default text alignment is left-aligned (text-left). However, Bootstrap provides
                            utility classes for different alignments, such as text-center, text-right, and text-justify.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="highlight">Text Decoration</p>
                        <p>&#8608Links are often styled with the default text decoration of underline, and Bootstrap
                            provides utility classes like text-decoration-none to remove the underline.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="highlight">Font Style</p>
                        <p>&#8608The default font style is usually normal. Bootstrap does not typically apply italic
                            styling by default, but you can use utility classes like font-italic to apply italic
                            styling.</p>

                        <p>&#8608The grid system is based on a 12-column layout, and it uses a combination of

                        <p>&#8608The grid system is based on a 12-column layout, allowing developers to create
                            responsive designs by dividing the page into 12 equal-width columns.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="highlight">Responsive Design</p>
                        <p>&#8608The Bootstrap Grid System is designed with a mobile-first approach, meaning that the
                            layout is initially optimized for smaller screens and can then be scaled up for larger
                            screens.</p>
                        <p>&#8608It uses a combination of media queries and flexible, fluid grids to adjust the layout
                            based on the screen size.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>&#8608The grid system is structured using containers and rows. The container is the outermost
                            element that holds and centers the grid.</p>
                        <p>&#8608Rows are used to contain columns, and they ensure proper alignment and spacing. Each
                            row consists of up to 12 columns.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>&#8608Bootstrap provides classes such as col-xs-, col-sm-, col-md-, and col-lg- to define the
                            width of columns at different screen sizes.</p>

                        <p>&#8608 A Button Group is a component used in UI design to group a series of buttons together
                            on a
                            single line. </p>
                        <p>&#8608 For example, a button group might be used to group together the controls for playing,
                            pausing, and skipping tracks in a music player interface, or to group alignment options in a
                            text editor.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>&#8608To create a basic button group in Bootstrap, you use the .btn-group class.</p>
                        <p>&#8608You apply this class to a &lt;div&gt; element that wraps around the &lt;button&gt;
                            elements you want to group. </p>
                        <p>&#8608Each button within the group is typically given the .btn class, along with any
                            additional classes to specify the button's appearance </p>

                        <p>&#8608In Bootstrap 4, Flexbox is a layout model that provides a more efficient way to lay
                            out, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown
                            or dynamic.</p><br>

                        <p>&#8608 Flexbox makes it straightforward to align items vertically and horizontally using
                            properties like align-items, justify-content, and align-self.</p>
                        <p class="highlight">Consistent Spacing:</p>
                        <p>&#8608Managing spacing between items is simpler with properties like gap, making it easier to
                            maintain consistent spacing in layouts.</p>
                        <p class="highlight">Dynamic Containers</p>
                        <p>&#8608Flex containers can expand and contract to best fill the available space in a variety
                            of display environments.</p>
                        <p class="highlight">Ordering and Orientation</p>
                        <p>&#8608You can easily reorder flex items without changing the HTML structure, and adjust their
                            orientation with the flex-direction property.</p>

                        <p>&#8608Flexbox allows for flex containers to be nested within each other, providing complex
